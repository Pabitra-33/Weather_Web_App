A weather web application which can give you any places weather information such as temp, wind speed and humidity.<br>

In this repository, we'll walk through the creation of a weather application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and OpenWeatherMap API. We'll utilize the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data and display it on our webpage. The goal is to create a clean, responsive, and functional weather application that provides users with real-time weather information.
